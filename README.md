# testing-out-pygame
tested out pygame, i dont think its for me. uploading what i made here so i can have something here and look back at it in a few years ig although its nothing interesting

probably will just use godot, from what i remember its wayyyy easier to make things in instead of having to make everything from the ground up in pygame
